We have had XXXX offers to present to them since the beginning. Instead of reviewing and submitting offers to the investor they continuously put the home on an Auction website called XXXX to solicit for other offers. This is a scam for Nationstar to continue to milk the servicing of this loan and eventually foreclose. They have not received any better or higher offers and they have scared away every buyer we have had by asking them to pay the full offered price plus 5 % on top for a service no one wants to use. Why would a Buyer we have already procured go and bid on a home and pay more for the house? Whats ends up happening is they offer less to make up the difference in the cost. In addition XXXX sets the opening bids low and congratulatesBuyers when they "" win '' the Auction. Then the bank turns around and tell us the bid was too low and the investor rejected the offer. We asked that they stop this useless practice and look at the offer at hand, they refuse. They have been sued in the past by other parties because of their fraudulent practices and we are asking that you reach out to them and request they take this matter very seriously. They are wasting the sellers time, every buyer who has come along, our time and the time if their investor. Thank you for your assistance!

There should be a class action suit for hundreds of millions of dollars in regards to the continuance of this dirty tactic!!!

I 'm astonished from the latest bill dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX of a value {$190.00} fees for what? As shown page # ( XXXX ), I 've never used your card and I 've asked to cancel it since XXXX XXXX.

The story begins back in XXXX of XXXX with my attempts to contact them to refinance my XXXX and XXXX mortgages because I knew that in the coming months I would not be able to afford both mortgages but might could if I combined them into XXXX. Despite numerous attempts on my part to get someone to contact me a out a refi, the time came when I was XXXX month away from having no more money to fall back on to make my regular payment. So I contacted their collection department to let them know about the impending doom. Since i was still current they could not help me, which I already knew but didnt know who else to call, so they transferred me to their loan modification department. I explained my story again and was told they could n't help me until I was already behind. I explained to them that XXXX Bank held the XXXX mortgage. They said do t worry about them because since they were in second position they couldnt take our house. When I finally had no other choice but to get behind I called their loan modification dept again. To make a long story short, after filling out the same exact paperwork XXXX TIMES and having them tell us on the XXXX XXXX attempts that they never received it, on the fourth attempt my husband stayed on the phone with an actual person until he received it via fax at which point we were told foreclosure had already been started and there was nothing that could be done. OF COURSE NOT!! 
Since that time which by this point was I think late XXXX, keeping in mind that I had to file BANKRUPTCY in XXXX to make this "" go away '' or so I thought. Since that time they have "" foreclosed '' on this house XXXX TIMES, didnt know that was even possible. XXXX of which were after I filed the chapter XXXX BK and they did send letters to us and run our names in our local paper each time. At the third attempt of their attorney contacting us, we had an attorney friend of mine send them a cease and desist letter. To NO ONE 'S SURPRISE they changed lawyers and contacted us AGAIN. They are going to run it in our local paper AGAIN! 
I will say this with 100 % honesty ; if I had known back in XXXX that it would take them this long to get their ducks in a row, I would have just lived for free in that house and AT LEAST it would not be in the shape it is in after having set for FIVE years basically unattended. 
This is ridiculous! It is unprofessional to say the least! I have NO CLUE how it is not perceived as harassment because LET ME ASSURE YOU I feel harrassed! Especially after I made every good faith effort I possibly could to work this debt out before it got to the point it did. 
The damage has already been done to me and my family by these .... People! Please investigate their heinous business practices and stop them from doing this to others.

The actual appraisal value of my home completely shocked and disappointed me. The appraisal value indicated that I am severely underwater by almost - {$80000.00} XXXX 80 % of the appraisal value in relation to the unpaid loan amount ). Refinancing, if it happens, is going to be a hurdle because according to Wells Fargo, the least amount of cash I would need to bring to closing is approximately {$45000.00}, with private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) premium payments each month. PMI will most likely take several years before it is eliminated based on how underwater I am currently. 
I want to honor my debt with Wells Fargo but I also want take advantage of the lower interest rates. I want to remain and continue raising my family in my home in XXXX XXXX. I am employed. Thank XXXX. I have never been late on payments of any of my debts, including my mortgage. Thank XXXX. I have a very good credit rating. Thank XXXX. 
I know that I am not eligible for assistance under HARP, because my original loan is not XXXX or XXXX XXXX. I was informed that my loan was packaged and sold by Wells Fargo to XXXX and that there are no programs to assist me, although I am underwater. This fact is hard to accept because accepting this fact would lead me to believe the saying that the "" nice gals finish last ''. This is a saying I am not willing to accept because I always step out on faith. I do n't think my issue is a unique one and I hope something can be done to help me refinance. 
I am writing to bring this to your attention and I am hoping to get some assistance as the window for me to refinance is closing. 
There should be some help extended to homeowners like myself who want to take advantage of the lower interest rates but can not because of having a underwater value to mortgages who are not HARP eligible because banks pooled and sold mortgages to private investors who have not done a thing to help since the housing market collapse. Some pressure should have been placed on these investors and help extended whether for HARP eligible or not.

Icontacted them and stated that this was not what I requested. Thelender stated that it could be changed verbally by either party. I said tochange it back. They stated they would. They called today to state thatthey would not. The lender stated they did not want to be involved. Istated they already were by spreading it to 60 months. The lenderrefused to change it back. So, it would appear the female co-borrowerhas the right to change my decision, but the male primary whose incomethe mortgage is based on has less rights on my own mortgage.

08/01/2015,Credit card,,Credit line increase/decrease,,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, Citibank Credit Cards reduced my XXXX limit to {$5400.00}. I have been in excellent standing with Citi, making all payments in time ( many times XXXX payments a month over the minimum payment requested ) for the past 8 years. I have always carried a balance on this card, while paying the card in full throughout my account history. 
When I called and inquired about my credit limit decrease, I was transferred to many people. XXXX agent was not understanding what I was saying and put in for a credit limit increase, when I simply was inquiring about the sudden decrease on my account. While trying to get clarification why an increase was made, the agent left the line and I was forced to call back. 
After calling back, a manager then forwarded me to the credit management department where I spoke with XXXX. XXXX said that the decrease could have been from many factors, he told me the utilization rate was high ( 43 % ) and I have too many inquires ( I just bought a house ). In addition, he told me that my debt-to-income was too high. After I told him this was because my student loan income based repayment was not factored in, which would bring my DTI down to under 20 %, I offered to provide documentation for this but was told this would not be necessary. I explained to XXXX why I had n't used that card as much as I used to, specifically since I was working to pay it off based on my plan, as I have done in the past, he cut me off to tell me that he understood but in order to reinstate my limit, he would have to pull my report and review it. If he thought it was worthy, he would then pass it along to his Supervisor to review and make a decision regarding reinstating my former credit line. 
When I asked what the criteria was in order to be passed along to the Supervisor, XXXX told me he could not tell me. When I asked to speak to his Supervisor, XXXX asked me, "" What do you want to ask him? '' Not only was the customer service disrespectful and unprofessional, but I felt as a loyal cardholder I was not being told information that I felt entitled to know regarding my own personal credit card and my banking 's criteria. I then asked to speak to the Supervisor regarding the criteria, XXXX told me that the Supervisor could n't tell me the criteria for a reinstatement and still did not let me speak to him. XXXX then pulled my report, reviewed it on the phone with me, came back and told me he would pass it on the the Supervisor to decide and I would receive a phone call or e-mail within XXXX hours. Today, I received neither a phone call or e-mail from the Supervisor, but instead a message in my Citi account page saying I was not reinstated with no explanation or personalization from said Supervisor. When going back to review this document, it was automatically deleted from my inbox, as well as my other messages from months past. 
Prior to my decrease, my utilization rate was around 43 %, and among all of my credit accounts with various banks. Now, with the limit decrease, my utilization of credit jumped to 63 % within a day, ultimately dropping my credit score from XXXX to the mid XXXX. When my credit was decreased, it was decreased to the point where only {$93.00} was available. Coincidently, that is near exact what my minimum monthly payments are for that card. The following billing cycle would have maxed my card out with interest, resulting in fees. It feels as if I am having the wool pulled over my eyes and am being thrown around the ringer as an easy target for money via fees. I am responsible for my credit standing. However, with this detrimental action, Citi has now affected my score without my consent. I currently have the money to pay off my card and will do so if my credit line, credit score and utilization percentage are not fixed.

08/05/2015,Credit card,,Credit determination,,"On XXXX XXXX I received an email fro XXXX XXXX that I had a delinquent account. I found out from their web site that the account was with THD/CB, which means The Home Depot / CitiBank. 
Home Depot Credit said the XXXX statement was returned to them by the post office. No attempts were made to contact me at all., I asked why, and the supervisor told me they do n't, legally, have to do it. They said they blocked my account and that if I had gone into the store and tried to charge something I would have known that. I do n't, very often, shop at Home Depot. 
While on the phone with the supervisor I paid the balance of my account, {$130.00}, and figured everything was OK. I asked them to remove the delinquency from my account and they told me they would not do that because it was not the bank 's fault the payment was late.I wonder how long it would have been if XXXX XXXX had not notified me of the problem. 
We spend half the year in XXXX and the other half in XXXX, I always fill out the "" change of address '' form at the post office, that rarely works smoothly. But I received and paid my XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX bill from Home Depot Credit. 
I have NO idea why XXXX 's bill was returned to Home Depot Credit, and they wo n't prove to me that it was. 
I have since talked to many of their "" supervisors '' as well as all three credit reporting agencies. They have contacted Citi Bank to see if they could change the status of the delinquency, but they refuse saying it was not the banks fault and I should have been paying on that account even though I was NOT receiving any monthly statements. 
I was told by one supervisor that they do n't have time to "" chase down '' everybody that 's late paying their bill. Another told me it would take "" a skyscraper full of people '' to contact people who have problems with their account. This ca n't be true because 3 yeras ago Sears Credit, also handled by Citi Bank, called me via robot computer and told me to call customer service about my account. I do n't recall what the problem was but it was solved then and there, they said they reach out to their customers as soon as a payment is late. 
I called 4 other credit card companies, and they said the same thing, but not Citi Bank. It seems as though they are just trying to cover up some mistake they made, the did send me a check for the late fees that accrued. 
I now have a "" black '' mark on my otherwise perfect credit reports of about 40 years. This is devastating to me because I 'm real proud of my credit history, now it 's messed up because of this mess.

Then if you do n't cancel within 7 days, they charge you the {$21.00}. This is in small print. They do n't send you a reminder email or anything. They are hoping that the average consumer will forget about it until they charge you. Then, even if you cancel as soon as they charge you, they will not prorate any of the money back to your account. This is not fair to consumers. The onus should not be on consumers to opt out of something seven days later. You should be able to opt out of the service immediately. Also, if you cancel they should prorate the unused portion of the service. A company SHOULD NOT be able to rob hard working Americans of {$21.00} through these sneaky tactics. I expect more from an agency who is has so much power over the livelihood of American, but instead they are robbing us. CFPB, please make this company change this policy.

I want to express my concern that your collections department is out of control and using bully tactics, high pressure tactics to compel a payment when it is not necessary is poor customer service. 
I have never had a call from collections before the grace period is expired in the 14 years I have had my loan with Wells Fargo or the companies it purchased loan paper from. I was answering a "" no caller ID '' phone call when I was assaulted by your collections representative and I hung up the phone when he was rude to me after I got him to admit that I was within the grace period for payment. These abusive debt collection activities are not welcome. Whenever I am asked, I say no to the question of being set up on an auto dialer. This is in keeping with the Fair Debt Collection guideline : under the heading 806. Harassment or Abuse ( 5 ) Causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number. 
I want to strongly suggest that he is the kind of collections rep that will give you a bad name. He was disrespectful in his tone and very cold. 
I conjecture that you are training people with this style of collection methods or the department has too many employees so they are making unnecessary calls to practice on people like myself. The only other reason would be that the company is in trouble financially so they are resorting to collecting from those who use the grace period to make sure all bills are taken care of.

All i know at this point, XXXX released the lien 11 years prior to moving my mortgage in XXXX, never cleared up the account issues and nullified the action of account with them being in default by cashing check in XXXX. It appears that in order to avoid further issues, XXXX XXXX sold the mortgage in a 'batch ' and let Green Tree settle. However, Green Tree could not provide information ( XXXX & XXXX ) never took my name or social security number to research and I was told by a representative that she could n't help me until after i received a special letter or she would be fired. I want them to release the debt that XXXX has already written off as bad debt, which was actually due to their error they never fixed, and remove it from my credit report and leave my home and well being alone.

My husband and I are currently unemployed. I called Navient on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and spoke with an agent in XXXX or XXXX. I gave him our Monthly income and expenses. He quoted me an offer fora Term and Rate Modification Program at an interest rate of 3 % for 15 months. Monthly payments would be {$280.00}. I told the representative I just did not know how we could cut {$280.00} from our expenses. 
He said he only spent {$100.00} per week on food and we could probably cut our food expenses. He also suggested that we cut our cell phone expense of {$170.00}. I explained to him this expense included XXXX cell phones and one home phone. 
I certainly do n't think someone living in XXXX has any knowledge of the cost of living expenses in the United States. I felt this comment was totally inappropriate and I was very offended. 
I told him we would get back in touch with Navient on XXXX XXXX, when my wife was here. 

Navient called us on our home phone and cell phone XXXX times a day. Sometimes, the message would say this is XXXX call me at XXXX, would not say what this pertained to. 
On Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 we called Navient, ask to speak to a supervisor, a supposedly domestic agent. It took a long time having to go through many phone prompts until finally I got a representative in XXXX. 
I ask him to transfer me to a supervisor, a domestic agent. He put me on hold, came back on and said I can help you the same as a supervisor. I told him again I want speak to a supervisor, a domestic agent. 
Finally I got a supervisor, a supposedly domestic agent name XXXX XXXX. He ask why we wanted want to speak to a supervisor. That the representative could tell us the same. 
REASON we did not want to speak to a representative was they gave us conflicting information about the loan. 
The domestic agent, supervisor offered us this program for XXXX months at {$280.00} as opposed to {$280.00}. The supervisor said, we would be charged an interest rate of around 13 % for the first XXXX months then the interest rate would be 3 % for the remaining XXXX months. This contradicts what the representative told us. 
They would not allow us to pay on line said we had to make automatic credit card deductions monthly. We agreed to these terms and electronically signed the appropriate papers on XXXX XXXX, 2015. 
As of today 's date XXXX XXXX, 2015 we are still receiving phone calls at home and on my cell XXXX times a day and the new rate and terms have not gone into effect. Our next payment is not due until XXXX XXXX, 2015, but my account show I am past due on my payments. I feel as though since I signed the forms with the new terms on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and agreed the due date would be the XXXX of each month that we should not be receiving any more collection phone calls from Navient call center. And, I never received a copy of the documents I signed or the new terms. 
If Navient can reduce student loans from 13 % to 3 % this should be permanent especially when people are in a financial bind. 
I 'm having trouble with how payments are being handled, received bad information about my loan, keep getting calls about my loan, having problems with customer service and ca n't get other flexible options for repaying my loan, ca n't temporarily postpone making payments.

08/01/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"My husband and I have been banking with Regions Bank for well over a year and have had very few issues with the service until we "" opted in '' for overdraft protection on our account in XXXX 2015. Since we have done this, we have incurred ridiculous overdraft fees for amounts that are already taken from available balance and held pending for up to a week at a time. We do not keep a register but have never kept a register, always checking available balance through Regions app or their XXXX phone service before and after each transaction. After each transaction the amount is deducted from available balance showing new available balance. The problem is since we signed up for O/D protection items are not being paid without O/D fees. Transactions that used to show pending for XXXX days are now pending for a week or longer. At the time of these purchases the funds are available, the amounts are subtracted but when they post the money has disappeared and we are being charged fees for moneys already made unavailable due to these purchases. I admit that there are times we have used the O/D feature for unexpected expenses or for gas or such things on short pay weeks, but we do not abuse this it is only used for emergency purposes. For instance, my husband 's paycheck is deposited every Wednesday night at XXXX. Any fees that are incurred are automatically deducted from these amounts and then we know our available balance. XXXX XXXX, 2015 we had a positive balance of {$9.00} and had to have our air conditioning unit repaired so I went to our branch ATM and withdrew {$200.00} knowing that left us with a negative balance of $ XXXX+a {$15.00} fee. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, our vehicle payment was drafted for the amount of $ XXXX+a {$36.00} fee. These amounts should have left our account at a negative {$420.00}. We do not dispute these XXXX charges, but we are now sitting at a negative balance of {$550.00} as of XXXX XXXX, 2015, due to items pending since Monday XXXX XXXX, 2015 which these amounts were already removed from available balance at time of purchases. By the time all items are paid that should have already been paid we will be at a negative balance of {$1100.00}. We do not have a problem paying the {$420.00} that we should owe but we do have a problem with {$680.00} worth of fees and items that should have already cleared because the amounts were not available after each purchase was made. If the funds were available at time of purchase and subtracted from account balance information, why are we getting charged fees and the amounts again? Where did that money go because it was not spent when we knew it was no longer available? Sounds like our bank has a worse method of handling than we do. I spoke with the branch manager and with corporate office and they said there are no mistakes and nothing can be done to fix this. This is the second time XX/XX/XXXX this has been an issue, the first time they actually refunded {$210.00} worth of O/D charges that were incurred for the same reason. Perhaps that is how they stay in business, ripping people off of their hard earned money, telling them there is nothing they can do about it, and they just eat it. Well, I do n't want to eat it anymore, and like many others stories I have read I 'm not the only one they have done this to. We have "" opted out '' of O/D program and will most likely be "" opting out '' of their services as well.

I advised them that I last used my bankcard on XXXX at XXXX just to purchase a couple of items. I was told to submit an affidavit for the items that I was disputing and was told that I will have a decision within XXXX business days. I contacted them several times within the XXXX business days to get updates. They came back with the decision and stated that they saw no fraud was made against my account because my pin number was used. I told them I had just recently received that new card in the mail and no one had the PIN other than me. Some of the fraud was made using a XXXX ATM. I went to the branch location where the fraud was done and asked if I can review the video from the camera and I was told that they had no way of showing me. I asked if the video was even reviewed and they could never give an answer which makes me think that it might be a SunTrust employee that is associated with the fraud. I was told by the SunTrust employee that I would have to do my own investigation and submit more proof to them. The associated advised me to go to XXXX to request the tapes to be pulled, which I did, and was told that they do n't have the authority to show me and video surveillance and can only be requested from the bank institution or an investigator. I also asked if a signature card was pulled to prove that the signatures on the back of the check did not match my signature but once again my request went unheard. I am requesting a full refund of all of the fraudulent items including the fees and a FULL investigation from SunTrust in house because I feel that SunTrust has frauded me and is possibly frauding other SunTrust members. The items that I am disputing are 2 checking that was deposited into the ATM one for {$910.00} and {$930.00}. There also was an ATM withdrawal for {$500.00} and 5 Wal-Mart purchases totaling {$260.00}. Also I have been a LOYAL customer with SunTrust bank for over 10 years and my account has ALWAYS been in good standings. I used this account for all of my personal banking needs such as receiving my direct deposit from my employer and paying bills. I have also incurred late fees because I am unable to pay my bills due to the fraud on my account.

I told the representative that I was not behind on my mortgage and had good credit so I was not interested in doing a loan modification. He advised me to do a loan modification to lower my payment. The representative assured me that there are XXXX type of loan modification programs, XXXX for individuals who are behind on their mortgage payments and another for individuals for individuals who are current on their mortgage. He advised me I should do the latter of the XXXX. We went through all my financial information and at the end the representative advised me I was eligible for the program and advised of my new payment for the "" life of the loan ''. The amount was lower than my current payment so I did ask many questions to confirm that this was all correct. The representative advised that I would not need to make a payment the following month and then only a small payment the next month but on the following month my new payment would start. All payments were sent up via Wells Fargo pay by phone system to which I have all tracking numbers and dates. The representative told me to call back every XXXX weeks to ensure I receive the proper paperwork that was needed. I did as I was told, I called back in two weeks and had all the information verified by the following representative that I talked to. I maintained everyone 's name and badge ID every time I called in to Wells Fargo. I never received the "" paper work '' that I was advised I should have received and continued to call every XXXX weeks to follow up. After I period of time, I started receiving collection calls and letters advising me of my delinquent status. This was the exact reason why I never wanted to do the loan modification. I was not delinquent on my mortgage when I initially called and at this time I was more than XXXX days delinquent due to the advisement of the Wells Fargo representatives. 
Eventually, I would receive foreclosure letters and would talk to "" many '' Wells Fargo representatives that would give me varied responses. I was told at XXXX point I was dropped from the loan modification program due to no payment. I never missed a payment, as they were all set up through Wells Fargo pay by phone system. All along I was told that I should have received some paper work to fill out, but was still not receiving. However, on a weekly basis I was faxing in financial reports to Wells Fargo but receiving nothing from them. It was not until I finally called my attorney and was advised to put his name on the account that the paperwork showed up at my house and a representative was able to finalize the loan modification process. While this would sound great, this caused great damage to my credit history as my mortgage loan fell severely delinquent, I was not able to get any other credit during this time and there after with good rates and the payment that I was told was far from the amount I was originally given. 
This process lasted from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. Almost XXXX years of stress that was not necessary. During this time and since then my credit history has severely been damaged and I do not know if I will ever be able to recover. 
While what I have stated above could never actually give anyone a real picture or feeling of what I went through that time, I am hoping that somehow Wells Fargo can reconcile this situation.

Unfortunately, we were ignorant to believe that banks do n't make mistakes, and we should have balanced our loan payments like we balance our check book. Although, we may have had some life events that caused our less than perfect credit, this loan still makes no sense because I am certain that had we only paid {$8100.00} to our principal balance in 23 Years, we would not still have our home.

The collection agency Midland Credit Management XXXX Midland Funding LLC placed the garnishment immediately after it was granted by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX here in XXXX. I immediately went to the courthouse on the next available business day and filed an emergency motion for a hearing because the money in the account was an entire paycheck and I need that money for bills and my car payment. It took them almost a month before I could see the judge which was on XXXX XXXX of this year. 

We attended the hearing with XXXX XXXX and after speaking with my mother and myself, showing them bank statements and pay check stubs from my account, the judge as well as the representative from the collections agency agreed to lift the garnishment from all three accounts, two of which were my mother and father 's. The judge even instructed the representative to expedite the paperwork to get the garnishments lifted as soon as possible. Since then, we have called the judge 's secretary as well as made multiple attempts to contact the collections agency who continues to brush us off and tell us that they have n't mailed the paperwork yet. 

It is now three months later, XXXX XXXX, and the garnishments are still on the accounts and I have not only incurred multiple late fees and overdraft fees due to this inconvenience and stressful situation, but I have also incurred other charges such as the filing charge for the emergency motion for a hearing as well as the stress of having to continually hound them to lift the garnishment. I am at my wits end. I have sent the Attorney General of the XXXX and the Attorney General of the XXXX where Midland Credit Management resides a complaint. I have also sent an email to both the lawyer on their case as well as to the Chief Compliance Officer at Midland Credit Management and I am still waiting to hear anything back. I mailed a letter to both the lawyer and Midland asking for them to please file the paperwork and lift the garnishment. 

I sincerely need help here because I feel so lost and hopeless, like I ca n't do anything about this situation and I am about to be out an entire paycheck of hard earned money that I need to help my family. This debt is not mine. I should not be held liable for that debt and the monies in that account should be returned to me. PLEASE help me.

Since I was laid off of work in XXXX of last year, we applied to Keep your Home California ( KYHC ), only to find out that we did not qualify because they stated that SPS told them that we were approved for their Unemployment Assistant Program. I called SPS and they assure us that we where approved for the unemployment program, and to wait for "" the letter '', this was back in XXXX of this year. Since then I have called every week and spoken to multiple representatives who have contradicted themselves over this issue. We lost assistance from KYHC because SPS claimed we were approved, then we were told that we were not approved that it was still pending, one of the supervisors said that in the computer notes it showed that we were told that we were approved without confirmation by the loan resolution department, when I asked to talk to that department, they said that they do not talk to clients directly. Last time I called a supervisor told me that he would escalate our case and we should have a definite answer by this Friday, that someone from the resolution department would contact us. I am soooo upset because we lost 2 months of assistance from either of the programs.

08/06/2015,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I made an online purchase for a professional exam review course from what appeared to be a reputable website XXXX BBB logo was displayed ). Instead of the review course, I received used and outdated books, and merchant was slow to respond. I disputed the charge with my credit card company, TD Bank. TD Bank was not helpful ; nothing was done by the bank to resolve the dispute, and the disputed charge was not reversed. After repeated calls, TD Bank told me I would need to fill out a dispute form, which they would send via USPS mail service. They refused to send the form to me electronically. After waiting a week for the form to arrive, I called again, and was told the form had been mailed, and would take XXXX business days to arrive. When it did not arrive, I called again, and was told it had only just been mailed. From the time I first learned about the dispute form, it took about XXXX weeks - and multiple phone calls to TD Bank - before the dispute form arrived. 

While TD Bank was doing nothing to help with my dispute, I continued attempts to work with the merchant, and on XXXX XXXX, 2015, the merchant stated in an email, "" I instructed our Finance department to put the refund through. It usually takes XXXX business days to process and show your account. '' The credit was never posted to my TD Bank credit card account. TD Bank was provided with a copy the email communication from the merchant, along with TD Bank 's dispute form, returned to TD Bank via priority mail service on XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, TD Bank acknowledged receipt of the email documents ( receipt date was said to be XXXX XXXX ). On XXXX XXXX, the documents were resubmitted via fax, at TD Bank 's request. As of XXXX XXXX, 2015, TD Bank has still not credited my account for the disputed charge, and representatives - even supervisors - are unable to provide information about the reason for the delay. When the dispute was first made in XXXX, I was told it could take up to XXXX days to resolve. By XXXX, TD Bank said it could take up to XXXX days to resolve ... and this is after the merchant acknowledged that a credit was due. 

TD Bank billed a late fee to my account while the dispute was pending. They did say it will be reversed, but this required another hour on the phone with them. ( I have always paid legitimate charges before their due date. ) Meanwhile, on XXXX XXXX, multiple fraudulent charges appeared on my TD Bank credit card account. I strongly suspect the scammer-merchant sold my account information. I noted the charges the day they were authorized ( while checking my account online to see if the disputed charge had been credited ), and called TD Bank immediately. TD Bank did not advise me to file a police report, nor did the bank advise me about placing a fraud alert on my account with the credit bureaus. Fortunately, a Google search did. I filed police reports with both my local police and police in the state where the charges were made, and a detective was able to obtain video of the fraudster. I also initiated a fraud alert with the credit bureaus. Although the bank was notified within hours, TD Bank did not immediately stop the charges ; instead, they posted the fraudulent charges to my account. TD Bank took over a week to reverse those charges. 

Throughout this process, TD Bank has not provided useful advice, has not adequately protected me, and has been very slow to assist in any way. My confidence in TD Bank has been seriously eroded by its handling of these events, and I am very disturbed about the level of service provided by this bank. 

At this time XXXX XXXX/XXXX/2015 XXXX, my dispute has not yet been resolved.

After a thorough review of my reports, I noticed that Capital One had placed an inquiry to my reports on XXXX. 

After speaking with representatives from XXXX, I was told to notify Capital One in writing and wait for their response. Once I received a response, stating that the inquiry should be removed, I was to forward it to XXXX. This is their procedure for removing a Hard Inquiry. 

I sent a certified letter to Capital One and it was delivered to them on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The letter asked them to either remove the hard inquiry from my credit report or send me proof that I had given them permission to run my credit. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a response from Capital One. However, the letter I received did n't indicate whether I had applied for credit with them. It was informing me of the different types of inquiries, which I already had knowledge of. So, I contacted them by phone and was told that I had multiple accounts with them and one is presently documented as a paid closed account on my credit report. I asked the representative if she could forward me any information regarding these accounts and after nearly XXXX minutes on the phone, she encouraged me to communicate with the credit bureaus. 
I have never had an account with Capital One and I have never applied for credit with Capital One. 

Therefore, I am filing a complaint CFPB, hoping to get a successful resolution of this matter.

After several months, I saw an offer from their website saying I could obtain "" significant '' savings on interest and cut years off my mortgage by changing from monthly to biweekly payments. I elected to do so, and only months later did I learn that the bank merely holds the first payment and does not apply it until the XXXX payment arrives. I was led to believe that payments had to be applied when received. I sent them an email saying I believed their practice is deceptive at best and predatory at worst. The question is, is it legal for them to do so? Is it legal to do this without proper disclosure? I requested that they retroactively apply my XXXX biweekly payment each month to the mortgage on the dates they are received. They refused. I spoke with an officer at another bank who said doing so is "" common practice '' in the loan industry. If so, and if it is legal to do this without disclosure, then please ignore this complaint. If not, then I wish merely to have my payments applied as of the dates received and a new amortization schedule sent to me. Aside from this, I am quite satisfied with my bank. **Please note that on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent me a letter fully explaining that the biweekly ( "" partial '' ) payments are withdrawn from my bank account and placed into an "" unapplied funds account '' until the "" full monthly payment '' is received.

They paid the vendor initially through my credit card account ending with XXXX, then reversed the amount when I disputed it. Then they closed the account ending with XXXX and provided me a new card ending with XXXX. 

Subsequently, they charged the full amount of {$980.00} back to the account ending with XXXX. 

The vendor who owes me a refund of the full amount ( {$980.00} ), claims that Citi Card never paid them the second time after reversing the charge the first time. I have been calling up Citi Card customer service for the past 5 months to get proof of payment made to the vendor so that I can submit the proof with the vendor and receive my full refund. I have already paid Citi Cards as part of my monthly payment. 

Citi bank refuses to provide any sort of proof. They keep hoodwinking me after making me jump from one person to another and making me wait on the line for 45 minutes to one hour every time I call. They claim that they will email the proof to my email address and they never send it. And they refuse to stay on the line until I receive the email. They promise me that someone will call me back and no one does. 

It 's been five months and I have no clue where my money is ( {$980.00} ). 

Citi bank tells me it is with the vendor 's holding bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and the vendor, XXXX, tells me their bank never received the payment from Citi. 

I have, frustratingly, been patient with both the vendor and Citi bank for the last 5 months and I 'm coming to you as a last resort. 

If Citi bank can provide me or the vendor with proof of payment, then I can receive the refund from the vendor. 

The vendor also asked me to ask Citi bank to open a formal investigation with their compliance department but Citi refuses to do so. 

They even refuse to provide me with a case number and I have to explain the situation every time I call to every person that my call is transferred to. 

They have harassed me for the last 5 months and have not been straight forward or helpful. 
Thanks & RegardsI demand that Citi resolve this issue immediately and help me in getting my money ( {$980.00} ) either through a refund from the vendor or recompensating me directly, depending on which party has my money.

Complaint ( Pre-settlement notification ) 1. I am filling a formal complaint after previous unsuccessful attempts to solve the issue over the phone with a call center operator. I am copying the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau responsible for supervision and enforcememnt of federal financial consumer protection laws. 

2. At the opening of my account with your representative XXXX XXXX XXXX at a branch located at XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY, I expressly rejected to consent to overdrawing and any fees associated with overdrawing. I made such a decision on purpose in order to avoid unintentional overdrawing and fees commonly associated with it. Therefore, I assumed that overdrawing from my account was not possible under any circumstances. 

3. On XXXX XXXX 2014 I deposited a check of XXXX USD issued by a third party. Consequently, I conducted XXXX transactions totaling XXXX USD. At that point I was not aware of the fact that the check had not been deposited to my account, as the Bank had not notified me that the check was not valid due to the issuer fault. Moreover, the Bank did not notify me that the account balance was not sufficient to cover the concerned transactions. The Bank charged me XXXX USD per each transaction, in total XXXX USD as an overdraft fee. This means that the Bank let me overdraw my account without notifying me of the failure to deposit the check and without my previous consent the Bank charged XXXX USD overdrawing fee. Furthermore, as a consequence of the previous, the Bank closed my account and claimed the fee thus effectively preventing me to settle the balance. 

4. I would like to emphasize that pursuant to law banks are required to disclose any fees when the deposit account is established and they may not assess an overdraft fee on an ATM or one-time debit card transaction if the account holder did not affirmatively consent or agree to the fee. I claim that these conditions have not been yet, particularly as I have never provided any consent. 

5. Therefore, I request cancelation of XXXX USD overdraw fee and notification of the payment method to settle the outstanding XXXX USD claim.

08/11/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"XXXX, 2015 met with Wells Fargo mortgage consultant XXXX to seek pre-approval for mortgage loan. I provided him with 2 yrs tax returns, 2 yrs XXXX, last XXXX paystubs and last 2 months bank statement. I am a 30 year customer of Wells Fargo Bank where I have a checkings, savings, CD and XXXX retirement plan in Wells Fargo account. I also have a XXXX credit score ( attached ). Received preliminary pre-approval ( attached ) and flew to XXXX KY where I signed on XXXX XXXX for a condo. Subsequently worked with XXXX & XXXX to provide rest of documents to secure final approval. XXXX XXXX received confirmation that I was pre-approved ( see document ). From there begin a series of requests and paperwork from Wells Fargo asking for sundry types of documents. Received a GFE from Wells Fargo as well and a subsequent notice the had locked in interest rate. All indications were this was a go. Around last of XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX I noticed communications had stopped coming from XXXX/XXXX and I was not kept in the loop on the status of the loan. I did continue to receive various mail correspondence from Wells Fargo, some of which contradicted each other. I had been told by XXXX to just ignore all of this, that he and XXXX were my contacts and would let me know what was needed. 
My offer on the property was scheduled to expire on XXXX XXXX so both my broker and I started calling XXXX on updates for the loan. In an email correspondence dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX informed us there was no problem, they had everything they needed from me and were just waiting for the HOA Master 's agreement. Over the next week, I continued to reach out to XXXX but without avail. I left him a message on XXXX XXXX asking for an updated status and expressing concern that time was running out. I did not hear back from XXXX or XXXX-it was as though everything had dried up. On XXXX XXXX my broker and I reached out again trying to get information. XXXX finally sent him a text saying he was no longer working for Wells Fargo ( attached ). In the meantime, I had called all over the Wells Fargo system trying to find someone I could talk to to find status. I finally obtained the number for XXXX boss, XXXX XXXX XXXX. After several attempts I reached her and the first thing out of her mouth was "" you know XXXX is not working for us anymore. '' I said nothing as the only way I would have known this is through osmosis. She then said, we can not verify your employment. Your company says they are not transferring you to XXXX. I immediately responded, "" I did not tell you they were transferring me to XXXX. XXXX is a local company. Why do you need this information? You have already verified I have been employed for the last 9 years at XXXX, you have my XXXX and copies of my paycheck. People live in one city and work in other cities all the time. This is a mobile society. I also stated my understanding of employment law is HR can only give out when I was hired and if I am in good standing. A discussion of transferring me to XXXX was a violation of my rights. I asked XXXX to escalate this issue at Wells Fargo as I needed an answer.XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX MST. I received a phone message at my house from someone from Wells Fargo in Illinois. Her only message was to tell me she leaves for home at XXXX and to call her back. The tone of her conversation was not friendly or welcoming and I could tell I was in for another excuse. I did not call her back. XXXX XXXX, ( 1 day before the contract expired ) I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX at XXXX mst stating they had received the Master HOA policy and the policy did not meet their standards ; therefore, they were denying me the loan. She stated I would receive some written letter. In a letter dated XXXX XXXX, the letter stated I was rejected because "" they could not verify my employment. '' What a crock.

08/02/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"Our mortgage loan was sold to Selene finance in XX/XX/XXXX. We had been making payments as scheduled. In XXXX a process server came to serve us foreclosure papers. We immediately called Selene to question the papers. We were told that "" no active foreclosure was showing up in the system '' and that they would contact the attorney listed on our paperwork to cancel the case. We called to follow up and were told repeated times this was in fact done. In XX/XX/2013 after 8 months had passed we were made aware that all proceedings had continued and a sale date was even set on our home. We were never aware of any proceedings because their own attorney had been filing and sending legal documents and copies of court proceedings to an incorrect address that was not ours. By their own admission they had been using the incorrect address. Court hearings and even a default judgement was entered against us. During this time we agreed to set up a six month extension to get these errors corrected and obtain a final arrangement on our loan. We agreed and made all six payments even though we had been making payments during the time of all these errors had occurred with Selene and their attorney. When it came time to get our final modification our paperwork came printed with the wrong address. A second XXXX came without the escrow so also needed correction. We signed and notarized a corrected packet and it was also signed and notarized by Selene. We thought this whole thing was closed out and we could move forward. The following month we sent in our payment and it was sent back with a letter stating our agreement was null and void. Stating we did not send it in even though clearly we did and it took a few attempts to get it corrected that should have allowed for the time it took. In the end all parties signed it and agreed it was in place. They then set another sale date on our home. We have been fighting this process the whole time. Ultimately they offered to reinstate the agreement based on the errors that once again occurred. We were asked to resubmit a new set of documents with updated financial info. We resubmitted everything in XXXX. I followed up several times and was told a decision would be about 30 days. In XXXX I called again to follow up and learned our paperwork was never submitted for review or even processed. A "" rush '' was put on it. The inspection was completed and submitted by an agent they chose even though we were the ones who were told it was still needed by Selene. A few days later a new approval was sent out via regular mail. 7 days before a sale date with one day to get it in. No terms were given and we were not even sure what they were. We received the documents the day before a sale was scheduled. The terms were more than the last signed and approved agreement with no terms given. Only XXXX payments going to a suspense account. We were not even guaranteed that signing it would cancel a sale scheduled at this late in the game. Following this a rep from the company came to our property stating a sale had occurred and no agreement was on file, even though we had paperwork showing differently. We feel this whole thing has been wrong from the start. We have shown diligence in resolving this and proof of payments. We have made sure to file complaints with all agencies locally and well as the attorney generals office to prevent this from reoccurring. It seems countless complaints occur almost daily about this company.

I called the bank to find out if they would take a settlement offer so that the offensive unpaid public record could be changed to paid/settled. The representative XXXX responded that they were not able to collect from me as a XXXX for {$3400.00} was issued to the IRS by BoA in 2011and neither can they remove nor change the balance of {$4000.00} from my credit - a letter was never sent to me advising me of this. Per the IRS website the company should instruct the credit bureaus to remove the debt as a XXXX is a debt cancellation which is reflected as a earning for the debtor and any applicable taxes will be charged. In addition to that, I believe the bank receives a tax write off for these debts.

In order to validate my information I am required to send them proof of my address by fax or mail. I am not going to send in paperwork on my address or anything else simply to close out a prepaid card and get a {$1.00} cent refund just so I can avoid the monthly fees that are accruing. I spoke to the "" supervisor '' of the information validation department ( XXXX ), who told me this is the only way I can avoid the fees. This is absolutely ridiculous on all levels. In order to avoid the fees I have to close the account, but can not close the account. Seems dumb. Just close the stupid account, keep the {$1.00} or send it to me, I do n't care, but I am not going to mail things back and forth just to update an address on an very old prepaid card. Seriously ridiculous. I may not be a customer of any Amex product, including the cc version if this ignorant behavior continues.
