07/28/2015,Debt collection,Mortgage,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt was discharged in bankruptcy,"My complaint is against BB & T. The story begins back in XXXX of XXXX with my attempts to contact them to refinance my XXXX and XXXX mortgages because I knew that in the coming months I would not be able to afford both mortgages but might could if I combined them into XXXX. Despite numerous attempts on my part to get someone to contact me a out a refi, the time came when I was XXXX month away from having no more money to fall back on to make my regular payment. So I contacted their collection department to let them know about the impending doom. Since i was still current they could not help me, which I already knew but didnt know who else to call, so they transferred me to their loan modification department. I explained my story again and was told they could n't help me until I was already behind. I explained to them that XXXX Bank held the XXXX mortgage. They said do t worry about them because since they were in second position they couldnt take our house. When I finally had no other choice but to get behind I called their loan modification dept again. To make a long story short, after filling out the same exact paperwork XXXX TIMES and having them tell us on the XXXX XXXX attempts that they never received it, on the fourth attempt my husband stayed on the phone with an actual person until he received it via fax at which point we were told foreclosure had already been started and there was nothing that could be done. OF COURSE NOT!! 
Since that time which by this point was I think late XXXX, keeping in mind that I had to file BANKRUPTCY in XXXX to make this "" go away '' or so I thought. Since that time they have "" foreclosed '' on this house XXXX TIMES, didnt know that was even possible. XXXX of which were after I filed the chapter XXXX BK and they did send letters to us and run our names in our local paper each time. At the third attempt of their attorney contacting us, we had an attorney friend of mine send them a cease and desist letter. To NO ONE 'S SURPRISE they changed lawyers and contacted us AGAIN. They are going to run it in our local paper AGAIN! 
I will say this with 100 % honesty ; if I had known back in XXXX that it would take them this long to get their ducks in a row, I would have just lived for free in that house and AT LEAST it would not be in the shape it is in after having set for FIVE years basically unattended. 
This is ridiculous! It is unprofessional to say the least! I have NO CLUE how it is not perceived as harassment because LET ME ASSURE YOU I feel harrassed! Especially after I made every good faith effort I possibly could to work this debt out before it got to the point it did. 
The damage has already been done to me and my family by these .... People! Please investigate their heinous business practices and stop them from doing this to others.

07/28/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"NO Options for Underwater Refinance HARP Ineligible Loans : As I completed the initial steps of the refinance process over the last few weeks, I had some uncertainty as to appraisal value of my home but thought that it was presently an ideal time to attempt refinancing as there were numerous sales in my area in the last XXXX months and at increasing prices. The actual appraisal value of my home completely shocked and disappointed me. The appraisal value indicated that I am severely underwater by almost - {$80000.00} XXXX 80 % of the appraisal value in relation to the unpaid loan amount ). Refinancing, if it happens, is going to be a hurdle because according to Wells Fargo, the least amount of cash I would need to bring to closing is approximately {$45000.00}, with private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) premium payments each month. PMI will most likely take several years before it is eliminated based on how underwater I am currently. 
I want to honor my debt with Wells Fargo but I also want take advantage of the lower interest rates. I want to remain and continue raising my family in my home in XXXX XXXX. I am employed. Thank XXXX. I have never been late on payments of any of my debts, including my mortgage. Thank XXXX. I have a very good credit rating. Thank XXXX. 
I know that I am not eligible for assistance under HARP, because my original loan is not XXXX or XXXX XXXX. I was informed that my loan was packaged and sold by Wells Fargo to XXXX and that there are no programs to assist me, although I am underwater. This fact is hard to accept because accepting this fact would lead me to believe the saying that the "" nice gals finish last ''. This is a saying I am not willing to accept because I always step out on faith. I do n't think my issue is a unique one and I hope something can be done to help me refinance. 
I am writing to bring this to your attention and I am hoping to get some assistance as the window for me to refinance is closing. 
There should be some help extended to homeowners like myself who want to take advantage of the lower interest rates but can not because of having a underwater value to mortgages who are not HARP eligible because banks pooled and sold mortgages to private investors who have not done a thing to help since the housing market collapse. Some pressure should have been placed on these investors and help extended whether for HARP eligible or not.

08/20/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I was looking to refinance my home and used XXXX to find me the top lenders in the US that had the best rates and lowest fees. The first one that came up was XXXX XXXX XXXX, so I called them. I got in touch with XXXX XXXX, Sales Manager. I told her that I would like to refinance my home and needed a quote. She asked me for some personal information such as income, credit score, home loan balance, cash out amount, what I thought the value of my home was, etc. which I gladly provided to her verbally. Once she obtained this information she verbally informed me of the rates and fees I qualified for. There was a substantial amount of information therefore I asked her to email it to me, which she said she gladly would and did at XXXX. We continued our conversation and I told her that the fees she 's charging are really high and that I was looking for a XXXX fee refinance with lower interest rate than what I was paying at the time. At that point she said that XXXX XXXX XXXX has the best rates and the lowest fees in the industry guaranteed. She continued to say that if they can not beat a competitor 's price, they 'll give me {$1000.00}. I said great, send the quotes on over and I 'll look it over and do my shopping to see if there are lenders with better rates and lower fees than XXXX XXXX XXXX. Low and behold I called about XXXX other lenders and all of them had lower fees than XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did n't want to bombard XXXX with all the details I received and instead sent her the lowest rates I found to see if she could beat it at XXXX the same day. She tried to call me at around XXXX the same day but I was not available so she emailed me saying "" I just tried to reach you by phone and did n't have any luck. I am questioning the validity of these quotes. If you receive a GFE please forward it over. '' I called her soon after and she questioned all the details on the quotes such as does it include all the closing fees etc. I told her it 's all there all she needs to do is click on the word "" details '' and it will show exactly what this lender is charging. She did that and saw that all the closing fees were there however she still asked if I could send her a GFE from this lender to see if she could beat it and that the quote is valid. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 at XXXX I emailed her a copy of the GFE as requested stating that the rate is at 4 % however it 's at XXXX cost except for the impound deposit. She replied back to me via email the same day at XXXX and said, "" A few things, after you proceed make sure you request a GFE that shows that your rate is good to a future date. The date on here says XX/XX/XXXX, which is understandable because they may not be able to lock your rate in until you submit all your paperwork but just make sure that once that happens you request GFE that shows the date the rate is available through is beyond today 's date otherwise you 're floating and anything can happen. Also it appears that this company is a broker, which means that they are banking on a lender to approve the rate terms and loan as a whole hopefully nothing changes. This is an excellent deal if it transpires. I wish you all the luck in the world and should you close on these terms go ahead and forward me a copy of the final HUD to take advantage of our terms guarantee pending qualification. '' That to me says that XXXX XXXX XXXX could not beat it. They are now refusing to pay the guarantee.

11/21/2016,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"This is a follow up to CFPB Claim # XXXX in which Ocwen says : "",,,, the investor of the account prior to receiving the payoff amount was XXXX. XXXX XXXX. However, Ocwen was servicing the account prior to the account 's payoff ; therefore, all inquiries should be directed to our office. It is important to note that the ownership of an account may change from time to time and in many cases will not be the original investor of the loan or remain the same throughout the life of a loan. '' My request was for Ocwen to ask his investor how is it possible that if XXXX XXXX obtained the assignment in XXXX ( per their documents which by the way has forged signatures ), assigns the loan in XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX who keeps it until XXXX but XXXX never clears the assignment ( per XXXX assignment issued by The XXXX XXXX XXXX issued in XXXX - copy previously attached ). 

XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted a XXXX to the shares against this unit in XXXX XXXX. It is clear that 2 parties were claiming ownership of the loan against my unit. Is n't this fraud? 

The fact that there was no XXXX continuation is irrelevant since Ocwen 's client - XXXX XXXX never cleared the original assignment. Therefore, I suggest that Ocwen obtain clarification from his investors. 
The mere fact that XXXX XXXX retained an assignment which remains unclear, and being that Ocwen was the servicer of the loan until its payoff in XXXX, gives Ocwen the obligation to file a XXXX. 
Based on Ocwen 's response which included a statement indicating that they have 'found ' a XXXX filed XXXX and their continued claims that they had filed a document with the county, indicates to me that they agree with my request above. However, they failed to note that the XXXX they found and enclosed, belonged to apartment XXXX ( It was not a typo. I owned XXXX units up until XXXX - XXXX and XXXX in the same building. I sold XXXX in XXXX ) Ocwen served the loan against apartment XXXX. Furthermore, how is that Ocwen does n't know what they filed. Very difficult to comprehend that the whole Ocwen team is this incompetent. 

Therefore, the recorded document they attached DOES NOT FULFILL OCWEN 'S OBLIGATION TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ACCOUNT IS PAID IN FULL NOR SUCH RECORDING MAKES IT A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD THAT OCWEN NO LONGER CLAIMS ANY INTEREST IN THE ABOVE PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO THIS ACCOUNT as they indicate since it reflects incorrect address and makes reference to the file against a different unit/shares. 

Ocwen further stated on the previous response : "" As previously advised, XXXX XXXX is an owner 's corporation/property management company. The XXXX and XXXX XXXX, previously provided to you, completed between XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which has XXXX Park 's name listed as an investor. '' It is unclear to me, what the role of XXXX XXXX is on my loan. Ocwen stated : "" XXXX as an owner 's corporation/property management company and then further states that XXXX XXXX is listed as an investor '' - -- which one is it and does that mean that there was a third investor on my loan??? why? and how come none of this was disclosed.

She was calling about a debt I owe to XXXX of {$150.00} or so. When I told her I was not working, not eligible for unemployment insurance and I do not have any money, she prodded me to get friends and family to help me. I told her that they are already helping me as much as they can ( I am living with family and they are making sure I have food and have access to a phone, car and car insurance so I can continue to look for work ). 

I explained to the woman that I recently got divorced and have a lot of bills that have added up. I told her that I am aware of the debt and plan to pay it as soon as I can. She then asked which bank I use. I told her I will not give her that information and she proceeded to tell me that I may as well just give it to her since they 'll keep calling and get it eventually. Then she started raising her voice and and said "" Are you trying to say not to call you again? Is that what you 're trying to say? "". I told her that it is illegal for her to harass me and that I had already told her I am aware of the debt, I do not have any money, and I plan to pay it when I am working and can take care of it. I told her that I was n't telling her not to call me again and she was talking over me, yelling and arguing. Eventually, she hung up on me. 

This conversation is the most adversarial and nasty one I 've ever had with a debt collector. It left me shaken up. I had a scheduled phone job interview with a potential employer right afterwards. I 'm hoping answering this woman 's call did n't affect my manner on the phone. 

I am trying my best to find work and be able to support myself again. I do not feel it was fair or legal for this woman to verbally abuse me on the phone. I answered the out-of-state number, knowing it was probably a debt collector, because I 'm being as responsible as I can. I do not like having outstanding debts and I try my best to deal with everyone who contacts me in a fair and respectful way. I am in an unfortunate spot in my life at the moment that will hopefully pass soon. Being abused over the phone by a debt collector adds insult to injury. 

I reported this because I do not want anyone else to be treated the way I just was.

04/26/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"When my ex-husband died in XX/XX/XXXX I was successor trustee of his estate. The only asset in the trust was his vacant house. He had a balance of more than {$30000.00} with Wells Fargo on the home mortgage. There were no cash assets in the trust. I made the $ XXXX monthly payment on the house because our XXXX son wanted to be able to live there. The house could not be lived in at the time because of the repairs that needed to be done, and we could only afford minimum outlay so he was doing as much as he could himself. Then my son died in XX/XX/XXXX, and I had no use for the house, and consulted Wells Fargo to see if I could sell it. They told me I could not sell the house unless I paid it off and got a new mortgage, which I was in no position to do. I continued to make payments through XXXX of XXXX when a real estate friend of my said I should find out if I even had to make the payments, since I was not the owner and my name was neither on the house or the mortgage. I consulted an attorney who told me I had never had to make payments from my own personal money, I only was legally obligated to pay from money in the trust. Since there were never any cash assets in the trust, I had no legal responsibility to make the payments. In XXXX I stopped the automatic withdrawals from my account and informed Wells Fargo by phone that I was not making any more payments. They still withdrew the XXXX payment. I was incensed! I called and demanded they return the money to my account. I once again explained that I was the successor trustee and was not obligated to pay. The representative said "" Oh, it does n't say you 're the successor trustee. I 'll have the payment returned. '' Which she did. My problem is Wells Fargo had a complete copy of the trust within XXXX months of my ex-husband 's death. The trust clearly shows no cash assets. They knew I was not legally responsible for the payments. My last correspondence with Wells Fargo was to inform them that they had no legal right to the payments I had made, and I wanted them to return the {$26000.00} they had illegally accepted. They wrote back, and the response was astonishing. It read : '' While speaking to you regarding the inquiry, you further advised me that the successor trustee was not personally liable to pay the mortgage balance. You also make this statement in our inquiry as well. 
"" At no time were you personally liable for this mortgage. Therefore we deny your request to refund the monies requested. "" I have had no further contact with Wells Fargo, though they continue to send statements to the estate of my dead ex-husband c/o me at my address. I finally wrote "" deceased '' on a letter and sent it back. Have heard nothing from them since. When they were still sending the estate letters c/o me, I learned they were putting the house in auction. This house, if in good condition, would be worth about {$40000.00}. As it sits, neglected for the last ten years, it needs a complete re-hab according to the building inspection. The cost would be at least {$20000.00}. I paid ( when I thought I had to ready it for sale ) to clear all the accumulated junk ( XXXX dumpsters ), clear the back drain, take down a diseased tree and keep the lawn mowed. I would dearly love to find a way to make Wells Fargo repay the money they knew they were not legally entitled to. I certainly want to keep them from doing this to someone else. I am XXXX, and in good health, but the next successor trustee might not be so fortunate. Wells Fargo should not be able to get away with this again. I would like to know if what they did was illegal, and if I can get my money back. I have copies of all correspondence and records of everything that happened from the date of the original mortgage to the date of the refinance.
